# Parking_System
Author: Krzysztof Gilewski
This is unfinished project!
This is my proposition for an automated parking system.
This system automatically collects information regarding the use of some parking facility (registration plate numbers, time of entry and exit, balance), calculates the appropriate charge based on the time the vehicle spent at the parking lot (assumption: first 30min is free of charge, 30c per hour charge applies after that up to maximum 2e), updates the balance, stores the traffic information as well as subscribed users in the data base, ensures the 
charge is paid before allowing the user to leave the facility - non subscribers, allows users to subscribe. Subscribers are allowed to leave the parking without paying as their balance gets updated with the assumtion that they will pay monthly.
